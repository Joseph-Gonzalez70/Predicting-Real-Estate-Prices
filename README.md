# Predicting-Real-Estate-Prices

In this project, I form a price prediction model for Ventura County Real Estate using data from Zillow. Zillow is a real estate marketplace that delivers information on homes for sale, for rent, and not on the market. This project focuses on homes for sale and Zillow provides both quantitative and qualitative data for these houses. While Zillow provides a wide range of information on these houses, this project considers the following house characteristics: price, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, house area, floor cost, heating existence, cooling existence, home type, garage type, total parking spaces, number of stories, house age, lot size, number of appliances included, foundation, fireplace existence, and city population. The goal is to use these variables to form an accurate regression prediction model.
